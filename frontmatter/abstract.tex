  This thesis describes the design and development of a virtual reality application for the Meta Quest 2 visor for the training of doctors and nurses in the field of pediatric cardiac surgery.
  The purpose of the application is the presentation of case studies through the immersive visualization of 3D models derived from imaging techniques.
  The application allows the creation of virtual classrooms where students can interact with 3D models of physiological or pathological hearts under the supervision of the teacher or independently.
