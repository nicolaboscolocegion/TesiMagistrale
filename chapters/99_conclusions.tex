\chapter{Future updates, trivia and conclusions}
\label{chp:conclusions}

\section{Needed work}
\noindent
The project is far from finished and requires additional work. The following paragraphs will outline the major updates needed.

\paragraph{Security}
There are significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in the backend, which currently lacks any form of protection. It needs a system for user authentication and token creation for both the \ac{VR} app and the web app.
Additionally, the \ac{VR} app will require a user-friendly authentication interface that enables end users to authenticate themselves without difficulty.

\paragraph{Feedbacks}
Due to the limited availability of surgeons, doctors, and nurses, we were unable to conduct a thorough feedback session in which they could test the new app. Completing this step will be essential for creating a strong user experience.

\paragraph{Ready for the store}
The app is far from being ready for the Meta Quest store. It needs to implement internet multiplayer and achieve a more stable frame rate when loading 3D models.
Additionally, it may require a new algorithm for creating \ac{LOD}s in real time.

\paragraph{Future features}
The app needs to be updated for new version of Meta OS, and the app could benefit from some other functionality like:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Online multiplayer
  \item	Slicing 3D models
  \item	3D models caching 
  \item	New environments
\end{itemize}

\section{Science4All}
\noindent
Science4All is a science outreach and inclusion project in Padua, aimed at making complex scientific topics accessible to a broad audience,
from young people to adults without a scientific background, with particular attention to people with disabilities or from disadvantaged backgrounds.\\
For the occasion, the \ac{VR} app was presented in the 3D printing section focused on medical applications. In a specially designed environment Fig.[\ref{fig:science4all}], we allowed children to try the \ac{HMD}, for many, it was their first time experiencing \ac{VR}. They had the opportunity to view a heart model, exploring both the exterior and interior in detail.
Both children and parents were captivated by the app capabilities and the medical use case for which it was developed.
